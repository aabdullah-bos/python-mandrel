Mandrel (python-mandrel)
==============

Mandrel provides bootstrapping and configuration tools for consistent,
straightforward project config management.

Use Mandrel to:
* bootstrap your python project configuration
* manage configuration file location/access
* manage logging configuration and Logger retrieval

Separate projects can rely on Mandrel for these purposes, and when they're
brought together (as eggs, for instance) to a single application, their
configuration can be managed simply in an easily-configurable way.
